# RedPlanetX
A small tool to modify videos.

Here is RedPlanetXv8 (RedPlanet Xpress) which is a tool that can modify video from Avisynth video or can create a video from scratch (in the future, with the drawing tool)

Functions:

- [x] Read video from Avisynth (works fine)
- [x] Load ASS with karaoke and display it (works fine, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Horizontal text (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Vertical text (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Text area (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Image mode (TODO with drawing, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Video mode (TODO with drawing if possible, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Add shape drawing over the video (works fine, TODO order of layers)
- [x] Set properties to shape (works fine)
- [x] Add a path to shape (works fine)
- [ ] Add drawing over the video (TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Add parent (Not Complete)
- [ ] Configuration (TODO)
- [ ] Encode with ffmpeg (TODO)

To test it I recommand to have Visual Studio 2015 Community because there is a lot of bugs or unfinished functions.
 
RedPlanetXv8 is in English only and code source contains some parts in French and English!

You can join me on Discord to speak or idle, in English or French (cause I'm a half white black Frenchy).
