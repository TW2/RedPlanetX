RedPlanetX
==========

A small tool to modify videos.

Here is RedPlanetXv8 (RedPlanet Xpress) which is a tool that can modify video from Avisynth video or can create a video from scratch (in the future, with the drawing tool)

Functions:
<ul>
<li>Read video from Avisynth (works fine)</li>
<li>Load ASS with karaoke and display it (works fine, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Horizontal text (normal text or karaoke, TODO, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Vertical text (normal text or karaoke, TODO, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Text area (normal text or karaoke, TODO, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Image mode (TODO with drawing, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Video mode (TODO with drawing if possible, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Add shape drawing over the video (works fine, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Set properties to shape (works fine)</li>
<li>Add a path to shape (works fine)</li>
<li>Add drawing over the video (TODO, TODO order of layers)</li>
<li>Add parent (Not Complete)</li>
<li>Configuration (TODO)</li>
<li>Encode with ffmpeg (TODO)</li>
</ul>

To test it I recommend to have Visual Studio 2015 Community because there is a lot of bugs or unfinished functions.
 
RedPlanetXv8 is in English only and code source contains some parts in French and English!
