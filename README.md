A small tool to modify videos.

Here is RedPlanetXv8 (RedPlanet Xpress) which is a tool that can modify video from Avisynth video or can create a video from scratch (in the future, with the drawing tool)

Functions:

- [x] Read video from Avisynth (works fine)
- [x] Load ASS with karaoke and display it (works fine, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Horizontal text (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Vertical text (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Text area (normal text or karaoke, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Image mode (TODO with drawing, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Video mode (TODO with drawing if possible, TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Add shape drawing over the video (works fine, TODO order of layers)
- [x] Set properties to shape (works fine)
- [x] Add a path to shape (works fine)
- [ ] Add drawing over the video (TODO order of layers)
- [ ] Add parent (Not Complete)
- [ ] Configuration (TODO)
- [ ] Encode with ffmpeg (TODO)

To test it I recommand to have Visual Studio 2015 Community because there is a lot of bugs or unfinished functions.
